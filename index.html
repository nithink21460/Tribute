            <h1>Perfect Personality</h1>
            <p>Captain Vikram Batra was born on 9th September 1974 and hailed from Bandla Gaon in Palampur district of
                Himachal Pradesh.
                Son of Shri Girdhari Lal Batra and Smt Kamal Kanta, Capt Vikram Batra received his primary education
                from D.A.V Public School,
                Palampur and then completed his senior secondary education from Kendriya Vidyalaya Palampur. After
                passing his second PU in
                1992, he got admitted in D.A.V College in Chandigarh. While in college Capt Batra joined NCC and was
                awarded the best NCC
                Cadet (Air Wing) in the North Zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consequently he got through the Combined Defence Services Examination and got selected to join the
                Indian Military Academy,
                Dehradun in 1994. He joined the Jessore Company of Manekshaw Battalion and was commissioned into 13 JAK
                Rifles, an infantry
                Regiment well known for its intrepid soldiers and numerous battle exploits. After being commissioned, he
                got posted to Sopore
                in Baramulla district of J&K as his first assignment. By April 1999, his unit had completed its field
                tenure and was preparing
                to move to its peace location. But the detection of large scale intrusion by the Pakistani forces in
                Kargil sector in early May
                1999 changed the operational scenario and the unit’s move to its peace location was cancelled.

            <h1>Kargil War Hero : June-July 1999</h1>
            <p>
                As part of Op Vijay, then Lt Vikram Batra’s unit 13 JAK Rif got deployed in Drass area of Kargil in June
                1999 under the
                operational command of 56 Infantry Brigade. After the capture of Tololing Top in Drass by 2 Raj Rif
                battalion, 13 JAK Rif was
                given the responsibility of capturing another militarily significant feature called Point 5140. This
                peak was one of the most
                treacherous and crucial peaks in Drass region and was heavily defended by the enemy forces. The Delta
                Company led by Lt Vikram
                Batra and Bravo Company led by Lt Sanjeev Singh Jamwal were assigned this task of capturing the Point
                5140 in a daring night
                attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preceded by heavy bombardment by Indian Artillery on enemy positions, the two companies began their
                movement towards the
                objective. The two companies were attacking from different directions to surprise the enemy however the
                climb was steeper
                in case of the Delta Company led by Lt Vikram Batra. At a height of 17,000 feet, Lt Vikram Batra and his
                men planned to
                approach the hill from the rear, to achieve the crucial element of surprise. Against all odds, they
                ascended the rocky cliff
                but as they neared the top, the Pakistani defenders pinned them on the face of the cliff with machine
                gun fire. Undeterred by
                this, Lt Batra and five of his men climbed up and after reaching the top lobbed two grenades at the
                machine gun posts. Lt Batra
                alone killed three soldiers in close combat and despite being badly injured during the exchange, he
                regrouped his men and
                continued the mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lt Batra’s courage inspired his men to fight valiantly and eventually the Point 5140 was captured. At
                4:35 am on 20 Jun 1999,
                Lt Batra sent the radio message, “Chanakya …it’s Shershah reporting!! We’ve captured the post! Yeh Dil
                Maange More” , which
                later on became the catch-line for the Kargil War. The victory paved the way for a string of victories
                at Point 5100, Point
                4700, Junction Peak and ‘Three Pimples’.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the capture of Point 5140, 13 JAK Rif was de-inducted from Drass to Ghumri to rest and move for
                the next operation.
                The battalion was then moved to Mushkoh valley and the next task assigned was the capture of Point 4875.
                Lt Batra had been
                promoted to the rank of Capt by then based on his earlier exploits in Drass. Capt Batra and his 25 men
                from Delta Company
                commenced the attack on the night of 06 July 1999. The plan was to reach the ridge, storm the enemy and
                occupy the post by
                the first light on 07 July. But unfortunately the evacuation of one of the officers, Capt Navin Nagappa,
                who had a badly
                injured leg, took some time and they were still short of the target by first light.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just before the objective, there was a narrow ledge manned by the enemy soldiers and it was almost
                impossible to advance
                specially in daylight. However Capt Batra decided that even though it was daylight he and his comrades
                would attempt a
                direct assault. In a rare show of extraordinary courage and daredevilry Capt Batra assaulted the ledge
                and took the enemy
                by surprise. However during the exchange of fire Capt Batra got injured but he continued his charge with
                support fire from
                rest of his men and reached the mouth of the ledge. Having got a foothold on the ledge as he was
                planning his next move, he
                noticed one of his young soldiers lying in a pool of blood few feet away. He decided to move the injured
                soldier to safety
                along with his JCO Sub Raghunath Singh. But as he tried to do so he was hit by a sniper fire in the
                chest. He breathed his
                last, uttering the words, “Durga Mata Ki Jai” meaning “Victory to Goddess Durga”, the battle-cry of his
                Regiment. Spurred by
                Capt Batra’s extreme courage and supreme sacrifice, his men attacked through the ledge and fighting like
                men possessed achieved
                the objective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Capt Batra’s bravery, camaraderie and devotion to his duty were extraordinary and would find exalted
                place in the annals of our
                military history. Capt Vikram Batra was given the nation’s highest gallantry award, “Param Vir Chakra”
                posthumously for his
                outstanding courage, steadfast resolve, leadership, and supreme sacrifice. Capt Vikram Batra is survived
                by his father Shri
                Girdhari Lal Batra, mother Smt Kamal Kanta and his twin brother Shri Vishal Batra.

            <ul>
                <li>“Either I will come back after hoisting the Tricolour (Indian flag), or I will come back wrapped in
                    it, but I will be back for sure.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Yeh Dil Maange More! (My heart asks for more!)”
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Don’t worry about us, pray for your safety.”

                    Capt Batra’s last words were, “Durga Mata Ki Jai!” (“Victory to Goddess Durga!”)”, the battle-cry of
                    his Regiment.

                    When a terrorist’s bullet meant for him had struck his man behind him during his first posting in
                    Sopore in Jammu and Kashmir: “Didi, it was meant for me and I lost my man”, he had told his elder
                    sister over the phone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the victory at peak 5140, Capt Batra had spoken to his father, Shri G.L Batra and said,”
                    Daddy, I’ve captured.’ His voice was unclear and his father asked him to speak again. ‘Oh Daddy,
                    I’ve captured the enemy’s post. I’m OK, I’m OK”. His father had replied, “Bete, I’m proud of you,
                    may God bless you to carry on your task there”.
